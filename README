NOTE:
1. cccmt is written on NetBeans 7.1 using Java.
2. Default METRICS.errors.xml does NOT have a root element.
3. Need to add <daveti> and </daveti> at the begin and end of xml file to make sure our XML is well-formatted.
4. java -jar cccmt -f abcd.xml
5. JDK 1.6 and above is need!

Thanks,
Dave
